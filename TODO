All algorithms:

- external properties, e.g. reaching goal or reporting error

ND:

- giant loop (in)variant

VFH:

- use timestamp not from the real-time clock but from the underlying position2d
  interface (which can be simulated and speeded-up)

- gnatd.V flag makes proof _much_ longer because of extensive flow-analysis

Formal.Numerics:

- runtime assertions for exclusive ranges, e.g. positive

- build scenarios with Ada and libc floating-point elementary functions

GNATProve:

- 'Loop_Entry in Loop_(In)Variants create constant values even if no assertions
  are checked (-gnata option is missing)

- loop variables, such as I in "for I in ..", cannot be used with Global aspect
  of subprograms nested in a loop

- 'Remainder attribute: full formalization

- loop invariants in nested loops (see common/ada/rec.adb)
