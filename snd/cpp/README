The Smooth Nearness Diagram driver builds as a plugin driver
called libsnd.  The following directions will install the 
driver for use in Player/Stage:

- Open the CMakeLists.txt file and verify the path to Player's
  installation.

- Build libsnd.so by executing:
            build; cd build; cmake ../; make

- To test the snd driver, follow the instructions in the
  README in the test sub-directory.
